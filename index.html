        This article will dive deeper into the controversy regarding predictive policing and weigh up the advantages of 
        predictive policing with the negatives. Predictive policing may have numerous clear advantages however there are 
        concerns and controversy that makes the community question the need for predictive policing and these will all be 
        visited within this article. This topic is a crucial one to cover as it will encourage open-mindedness showing 
        both sides of the controversy and hopefully lead to improvements regarding the current Predictive Policing system. 
        There are gaps in research about predictive modelling when it comes to clear and sufficient evidence base to prove 
        the benefits or drawbacks.

    <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="ex1" id="Introduction_InText">
        “Predictive policing models rely on computer systems' ability to analyse large sets of data, as well as historical 
        crime data, to help make more effective choices and decisions about things like the location and quantity of police 
        deployment or the identification of individuals who are likely to be victims or perpetrators of crime. There are two 
        applications of predictive modelling with the key difference being the input information they use to produce the 
        predictions. The first application takes in the use of arrest data to help predict likely physical crime hotspots. 
        The second application uses social media data to identify individuals and how likely it is that they will commit crime.”

    <h4>ADVANTAGES</h4>
    <h5> 1. Reduce Crime:</h5>
    <p class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
            Predictive Policing has been said to be suitable choice of action for the reduction of crime with a few examples being able to 
        back the claim. For instance, the police department in Dubai were able to see a reduction to major crimes by 25% within months of 
        when they began using crime prediction. Departments were able to label and identify time frames and areas with higher probabilities 
        of major crimes such as vehicle theft and burglary. This enabled them to properly allocate resources and attention to those areas 
        which as a result led to a drop in crime overall in comparison to the previous year. [0]
    </p>

    <h5> 2. Improved Decision Making:</h5>
    <p>
            The use of predictive models refines and enhances decision making allowing all levels of an organisation to get insights 
        relevant to them by their historical data. The availability of the information in abundance discourages police from making decisions 
        that may be based on bias rather than evidence. These predictive models are used to boost the operational efficiency of organisations
        and police departments. The more efficient police departments are, the more the public benefits as order is better maintained.

    <h4>DISADVANTAGES</h4>
    <h5> 1. Privacy concerns:</h5>
    <p>
            With the consideration of the second application of predictive policing mentioned earlier, we can understand that it poses 
        serious privacy concerns as it uses data about individuals gathered from the internet. Data stored by the police department is 
        susceptible to data leaks as data security requires training and personnel which could be quite costly. This allows for the 
        possibility of private personal data being leaked which
    </p>

    <h5> 2. Discrimination and Lack of transparency: </h5>
    <p>
            Another key concern regarding predictive modelling is that AI models can develop biases from the data that they will be taking in. 
        This in turn can lead to policing practices that are discriminatory. Additionally predictive policing algorithms do not allow for 
        public input on decisions regarding policing and resource allocations are made. The nature of predictive policy additionally doesn’t 
        allow the public to understand how decisions on policing are made. This in turn erodes the trust of the specific demographics and 
        the public with Police departments.
